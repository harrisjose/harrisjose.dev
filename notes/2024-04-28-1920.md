Evolu creates and stores CRDT messages locally and derives actual DB from them. The most simple CRDT mutation (and the only one implemented right now) is the last write win. A CRDT message contains a table, row, column, value, and timestamp because every CRDT message has to have a timestamp to ensure globally stable ordering via hybrid logical clocks(opens in a new tab).
