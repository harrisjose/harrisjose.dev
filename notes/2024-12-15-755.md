Why can't we just move SQLite to io_uring?

> Replacing the POSIX I/O calls with io_uring is not trivial, and applications that use blocking I/O must be re-designed for the asynchronous I/O model of io_uring. Specifically, applications now need to handle the situation of I/O submission in their control flow. In the case of SQLite, the library needs to return control to the application when I/O is in flight.

In other words: you need to rewrite a whole lot of SQLite.
